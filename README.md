# SecureIT

Safety Redefined.
A product that ensures your home is safe from intruders using face recognition algorithm.We have used Computer Vision and Deep Learning to solve this problem, Our realtime IP camera stream would have the record of all the happenings around the house this further would livestream on a python server which has a pretrained model to detect whether the person is an intruder or not. If the person comes out to be an intruder then the app notifies the user that an intruder just entered the house.

- Connect a device
- Run ```flutter run``` on your terminal

## The Website
- Dive into the website folder
- Click onto the ```main.html``` file

## Our model detecting us :smiley:
- Our Deep Learning model is stored inside ```DeepLearning``` directory
Run this on your terminal
- ```cd DeepLearning```
- ```mkdir dataset```
- Then run the file
